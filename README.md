# Amazon-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP-and-DeepLearning

Alot of projects using this dataset have been already done, however i did not find any particular project that used transformers to do sentiment analysis.
I decided to make one of my own and surprisingly got better accuray than all of the projects I came across
I started with a test model using fastAI as you can develop a model in a few lines of code however that did not bring about great results. 
Decided to give it another try using Huggingface Transformers library and achieved an accuracy of 94%.
Im pretty sure using ensemble techniques or TTA will give even better results and I aim to test that out when I have the time later.
